        <li>FIX: Correct regex newline composition in VS 2010 <strong>Replace with</strong>
            field. When <strong>Replace with</strong> field contained a newline, an extra "r"
            character was appended at the end of line. Only VS 2010 was affected, it worked
            fine in all other VS versions.</li>
