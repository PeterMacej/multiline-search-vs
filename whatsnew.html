        <li>CHANGE: The multiline search/replace dialog is no longer modal. Now it is <strong>
            modeless tool window</strong> which can be sized and docked as any other VS tool
            window.</li>
        <li>FIX: In VS 2012 and 2013, the "\"
            character in the <strong>Replace with</strong>
            field was incorrectly escaped to regex as "\\". That produced double backslash in
            replaced text. So if you wanted to replace with e.g. "C:\MyFolder\root\nextLevel\test",
            you got "C:\\MyFolder\\root\\nextLevel\\test". </li>
        <li>FIX: In VS 2012 and 2013, if you replaced a string with an empty string (you wanted
            to delete the string), the extension produced "\9" in <strong>Replace with</strong>
            field.While this produces an empty text in VS 2005-2010, it doesn't work in newer
            versions. In VS 2012 and 2013, the "$+" is used now. Unfortunatelly, it's not possible
            to pre-populate the <strong>Replace with</strong> field directly with an empty text
            because VS automatically inserts the last used value from the history. That's why
            such a hack is needed.</li>
    </ol>
