        <li>FIX: After filling in the fields in the multiline search/replace dialog and pressing any of the buttons, the standard search/replace dialog appears. When this happened for the first time, its Find what field was incorrectly populated with the selected text from the editor, instead of the generated regex. This only occurred if it was set in Tools - Options - Environment - Find and Replace. This problem only occurred in version 2.0.</li>
        <li>FIX: If the replace text contained $, double $$ was inserted sometimes.</li>
